# About This Project
This is a college football application that I made for my senior capstone project in college. IT is a full stack application built using the MERN stack.

# Technologies
React.js
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB

# How it Works
This application includes both a frontend and a backend. I first created my database on MongoDB and pulled the connection string and assigned it to an atlas URI. I also included express routers to act as a middleware. After completing the backend, I moved on to the frontend. I created a react app using the npx create-react-app command. I implemented function components to make my code easier to understand. I also implemented react router since my application had multiple pages.
